SOAP::WSDL::Manual - Accessing WSDL based web services

=head1 Accessing a WSDL-based web service

=head2 Quick walk-through for the unpatient

=over

=item * Create WSDL bindings

  perl wsdl2perl.pl -b base_dir URL

=item * Look what has been generated

Check the results of the generator. There should be one
MyInterfaces/SERVICE_NAME/PORT_NAME.pm file per port (and one directory per
service).

=item * Write script

 use MyInterfaces::SERVICE_NAME::PORT_NAME;
 my $service = MyInterfaces::SERVICE_NAME::PORT_NAME->new();

 my $result = $service->SERVICE_METHOD();
 die $result if not $result;

 print $result;

C<perldoc MyInterfaces::SERVICE_NAME::PORT_NAME> should give you some overview
about the service's interface structure.

The results of all calls to your service object's methods (except new) are
objects based on SOAP::WSDL's XML schema implementation.

To access the object's properties use get_NAME / set_NAME getter/setter
methods with NAME corresponding to the XML tag name / the hash structure as
showed in the generated pod.

=item  * Run script

=head2 Instrumenting web services with interface classes

SOAP::WSDL (starting from 2.00) instruments WSDL based web services with
interface classes. This means that SOAP::WSDL features a code generator
which creates one class for every web service you want to access.

Moreover, the data types from the WSDL definitions are also wrapped into
classes and returned to the user as objects.

To find out which class a particular XML node should be, SOAP::WSDL uses the
information built into type classes and interfaces.

Older versions of SOAP::WSDL used typemaps. For every Web service, a typemap
was created. Typemaps were dropped, as they don't allow recursive XML schema
declarations, eat up more memory and are slower. Old interfaces using typemaps
are still supported, but you're encouraged to re-generate your interfaces.

=head2 Interface class creation

To create interface classes, follow the steps above from
L<Quick walk-through for the unpatient|Quick walk-through for the unpatient>.

If this works fine for you, skip the next paragraphs. If not, read on.

The steps to instrument a web service with SOAP::WSDL perl bindings
(in detail) are as follows:

=over

=item * Gather web service information

You'll need to know at least a URL pointing to the web service's WSDL
definition.

If you already know more - like which methods the service provides, or how
the XML messages look like, that's fine. All these things will help you
later.

=item * Create WSDL bindings

 perl wsdl2perl.pl -b base_dir URL

This will generate the perl bindings in the directory specified by base_dir.

For more options, see L<wsdl2perl.pl> - you may want to specify class
prefixes for XML type and element classes, type maps and interface classes,
and you may even want to add custom typemap elements.

=item * Check the result

There should be a bunch of classes for types (in the MyTypes:: namespace by
default), elements (in MyElements::), and one or more interface classes
(in MyInterfaces::). Older versions also produced at least one typemap (in
MyTypemaps::), which isn't needed any more.

If you don't already know the details of the web service you're going to
instrument, it's now time to read the perldoc of the generated interface
classes. It will tell you what methods each service provides, and which
parameters they take.

If the WSDL definition is informative about what these methods do, the
included perldoc will be, too - if not, blame the web service author.

=item * Write a perl script (or module) accessing the web service.

 use MyInterfaces::SERVICE_NAME::PORT_NAME;
 my $service = MyInterfaces::SERVICE_NAME::PORT_NAME->new();

 my $result = $service->SERVICE_METHOD();
 die $result if not $result;
 print $result;

The above handling of errors ("die $result if not $result") may look a bit
strange - it is due to the nature of the
L<SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Fault11|SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Fault11>
objects SOAP::WSDL uses for signalling failure.

These objects are false in boolean context, but serialize to their XML
structure on stringification.

You may, of course, access individual fault properties, too. To get a list of
fault properties, see L<SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Fault11>

=back

=head2 Adding missing information

Sometimes, WSDL definitions are incomplete. In most of these cases, proper
fault definitions are missing. This means that though the specification says
nothing about it, Fault messages include extra elements in the
E<lt>detailE<gt> section, or errors are even indicated by non-fault messages.

There are two steps you need to perform for adding additional information.

=over

=item * Provide required type classes

For each extra data type used in the XML messages, a type class has to be
created.

It is strongly discouraged to use the same namespace for hand-written and
generated classes - while generated classes may be many, you probably will
only implement a few by hand. These (precious) few classes may get lost in
the mass of (cheap) generated ones. Just imagine one of your co-workers (or
even yourself) deleting the whole bunch and re-generating everything - oops
- almost everything. You get the point.

For simplicity, you probably just want to use builtin types wherever possible
- you are probably not interested in whether a fault detail's error code is
presented to you as a simpleType ranging from 1 to 10 (which you have to
write) or as an int (which is a builtin type ready to use).

Using builtin types for simpleType definitions may greatly reduce the number
of additional classes you need to implement.

If the extra type classes you need include E<lt>complexType E<gt> or
E<lt>element /E<gt> definitions, see L<SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::ComplexType>
and L<SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Element> on how to create ComplexType and
Element type classes.

=item * Provide a typemap snippet to wsdl2perl.pl

SOAP::WSDL uses typemaps for finding out into which class' object a XML node
should be transformed.

Typemaps basically map the path of every XML element inside the Body tag to a
perl class.

Typemap snippets have to look like this (which is actually the default Fault
typemap included in every generated one):

 (
 'Fault' => 'SOAP::WSDL::SOAP::Typelib::Fault11',
 'Fault/faultcode' => 'SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::anyURI',
 'Fault/faultactor' => 'SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::anyURI',
 'Fault/faultstring' => 'SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string',
 'Fault/detail' => 'SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::anyType',
 );

The lines are hash key - value pairs. The keys are the XPath expressions
without occurence numbers (like [1]) relative to the Body element.
Namespaces are ignored.

If you don't know about XPath: They are just the names of the XML tags,
starting from the one inside E<lt>BodyE<gt> up to the current one joined by /.

One line for every XML node is required.

You may use all builtin, generated or custom type class names as values.

Use wsdl2perl.pl -mi=FILE to include custom typemap snippets.

Note that typemap include files for wsdl2perl.pl must evaluate to a valid
perl hash - it will be imported via eval (OK, to be honest: via I<do $file>,
but that's almost the same...).

Your extra statements are included last, so they override potential typemap
statements with the same keys.

=head1 Accessing a web service without a WSDL definition

Accessing a web service without a WSDL definition is more cumbersome. There
are two ways to go:

=over

=item * Write a WSDL definition and generate interface

This is the way to go if you already are experienced in writing WSDL files.
If you are not, be warned: Writing a correct WSDL is not an easy task, and
writing correct WSDL files with only a text editor is almost impossible.
You should definitely use a WSDL editor. The WSDL editor should support
conformance checks for the WS-I Basic Profile (1.0 is preferred by
SOAP::WSDL)

=item * Write a typemap and class library from scratch

If the web service is relatively simple, this is probably easier than first
writing a WSDL definition. Besides, it can be done in perl, a language you
are probably more familiar with than WSDL.

L<SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::ComplexType>, L<SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::SimpleType> and
L<SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Element> tell you how to create subclasses of XML schema
types.

L<SOAP::WSDL::Manual::Parser> will tell you how to create a typemap class.

=back

=head1 Creating a SOAP Server

Creating a SOAP server works just like creating a client - just add the
C<--server> or C<-s> option to the call to C<wsdl2perl.pl>.

 perl wsdl2perl.pl -s -b BASE_DIR URL

SOAP::WSDL currently includes classes for building a basic CGI and a
mod_perl 2 based SOAP server.

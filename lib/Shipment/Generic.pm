  use Shipment::Address;
  use Shipment::Package;

  my $shipment = Shipment::Generic->new(
    from_address => Shipment::Address->new( ... ),
    to_address => Shipment::Address->new( ... ),
    packages => [ Shipment::Package->new( ... ), ],
  );

  $shipment->rate( 'ground' );

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 _build_services

This routine simply adds a single "generic" service

=cut

sub _build_services {
  { 
    generic => 
      Shipment::Service->new(
        id => 'generic',
        name => 'Generic Service',
      ),
  }
}

=head2 rate

This routine populates $self->service

It optionally accepts the cost passed as the second argument

  $shipment->rate( 'ground', '12.34 );
  print $shipment->service->cost . "\n";

=cut

sub rate {
  my ( $self, $service_id, $rate ) = @_;

  $service_id ||= 'generic';
  $rate ||= 0;

      use Data::Currency;
      use Shipment::Service;
      $self->service( 
        new Shipment::Service( 
          id        => $service_id,
          name      => $service_id,
          cost      => Data::Currency->new($rate, $self->currency),
        )
      );

}

=head2 ship

This routine sets $self->tracking_id and calls $self->rate
Also sets a label for each package

  $shipment->ship( 'ground', '123456789', '12.32' );

TODO: create generic thermal, pdf, and png labels so that we can do:
  $shipment->get_package(0)->label->save;

=cut

sub ship {
  my ( $self, $service_id, $tracking_id, $rate ) = @_;

  $self->rate($service_id, $rate);

  if (!$tracking_id) {
    foreach (@{ $self->packages }) {
      $tracking_id = $_->tracking_id if $_->tracking_id;
      last if $_->tracking_id;
    }
  }

  $tracking_id ||= 'n/a';

  $self->tracking_id( $tracking_id );

  use Shipment::Label;

  foreach (@{ $self->packages }) { 
    $_->tracking_id( $tracking_id ) if !$_->tracking_id;
    $_->label(
      Shipment::Label->new(
        {
          tracking_id => $_->tracking_id,
          content_type => 'text/plain',
          data => qq|

          file_name => $_->tracking_id . '.txt',
        },
      )
    );
  }

}

=head2 cancel

This routine really does nothing but return 'success'

  $shipment->tracking_id( '12345' );
  $shipment->cancel;

=cut

sub cancel {
  my $self = shift;

  return 'success';
}

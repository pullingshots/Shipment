=head1 NAME



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined simpleType
ReturnedRateType from the namespace http://fedex.com/ws/ship/v9.

The "PAYOR..." rates are expressed in the currency identified in the payor's rate table(s). The "RATED..." rates are expressed in the currency of the origin country. Former "...COUNTER..." values have become "...RETAIL..." values, except for PAYOR_COUNTER and RATED_COUNTER, which have been removed.



This clase is derived from 
   SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string
. SOAP::WSDL's schema implementation does not validate data, so you can use it exactly
like it's base type.

# Description of restrictions not implemented yet.

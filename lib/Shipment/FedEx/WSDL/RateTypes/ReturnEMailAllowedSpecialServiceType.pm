=head1 NAME



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined simpleType
ReturnEMailAllowedSpecialServiceType from the namespace http://fedex.com/ws/rate/v9.

These values are used to control the availability of certain special services at the time when a customer uses the e-mail label link to create a return shipment.



This clase is derived from 
   SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string
. SOAP::WSDL's schema implementation does not validate data, so you can use it exactly
like it's base type.

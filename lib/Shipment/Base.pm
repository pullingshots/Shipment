=head1 NAME

Shipment::Base - base class for a shipping module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module does not DO anything, but can be extended to create a real
interface for a shipping service.

  package Shipment::SomeShippingService;

  use Moose;

  extends 'Shipment::Base';

  sub ship {
    # routine to ship something somewhere via some shipping service
  }

  no Moose;

which can then be used to actually DO stuff:

  use Shipment::SomeShippingService;
  use Shipment::Address;
  use Shipment::Package;

  my $shipment = Shipment::SomeShippingService->new(
    from_address => Shipment::Address->new( ... ),
    to_address => Shipment::Address->new( ... ),
    packages => [ Shipment::Package->new( ... ), ],
  );

  $shipment->ship( 'ground' );

=head1 ABOUT

This is a base class for a shipping service such as UPS or FedEx.

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 _build_services

The routine which compiles a list of available shipping services for from and to addresses.

  foreach my $service ( $shipment->all_services ) {
    print $service->name . "\n";
  }

Standard services - ground, express, priority - can be mapped to actual service id's

  print $shipment->services->{ground}->id . "\n";

=cut

sub _build_services {
  warn "routine '_build_services' has not been implemented";
  { 
    ground => 
      Shipment::Service->new(
        id => 'ground',
        name => 'Example Ground Service',
        etd => 4, ## Estimated Transit Days
        cost => Data::Currency->new(1),
      ),
    express => 
      Shipment::Service->new(
        id => 'express',
        name => 'Example Express Service',
        etd => 2, ## Estimated Transit Days
        cost => Data::Currency->new(10),
      ),
    priority => 
      Shipment::Service->new(
        id => 'priority',
        name => 'Example Priority Service',
        etd => 1, ## Estimated Transit Days
        cost => Data::Currency->new(100),
      ),
  }
}

=head2 rate

The routine that fetches a detailed rate for a given service type

  $shipment->rate( 'ground' );
  print $shipment->service->cost . "\n";
  print $shipment->service->etd . "\n";

=cut

sub rate {
  my ( $self, $service_id ) = @_;

  warn "routine 'rate' is not implemented for $self";
}

=head2 ship

The routine that creates a shipment/label

  $shipment->ship( 'ground' );
  $shipment->get_package(0)->label->save;

=cut

sub ship {
  my ( $self, $service_id ) = @_;

  warn "routine 'ship' is not implemented for $self";
}

=head2 return

The routine that creates a return shipment

  $shipment->return( 'ground' );

=cut

sub return {
  my ( $self, $service_id ) = @_;

  warn "routine 'return' is not implemented for $self";
}

=head2 cancel

The routine that cancels a shipment

  $shipment->tracking_id( '12345' );
  $shipment->cancel;

=cut

sub cancel {
  my ( $self, $service_id ) = @_;

  warn "routine 'cancel' is not implemented for $self";
}

=head2 end_of_day

The routine that runs end of day close

sub end_of_day {
  my ( $self, $service_id ) = @_;

  warn "routine 'end_of_day' is not implemented for $self";
}

=head2 track

The routine that fetches tracking information

  $shipment->tracking_id( '12345' );
  $shipment->track;

=cut

sub track {
  my $self = shift;

  warn "routine 'track' is not implemented for $self";
}

=head2 coerce_datetime

In the pre-Moo era L<Shipment> used L<MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained>
for DateTime types but now we use L<MooX::Types::MooseLike::DateTime> which
does not do coercion for us.

This method provides coercion for DateTime/DateAndTime types in the way
existing code expects it to work so we don't break anything.

=cut

sub coerce_datetime {
    if ( blessed( $_[0] ) and ( blessed( $_[0] ) eq 'DateTime' ) ) {
        return $_[0];
    }
    elsif ( ref($_[0]) eq 'HASH' ) {
        return DateTime->new( %{$_[0]} );
    }
    elsif ( ref($_[0]) eq '' && $_[0] =~ /^\d+/ ) {
        return DateTime->from_epoch( epoch => $_[0] )
    }
    elsif ( ref($_[0]) eq '' && $_[0] eq 'now' ) {
        return DateTime->now;
    }
    else {
        return return exception_message($_[0], 'a DateTime object');
    }
}

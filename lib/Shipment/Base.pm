=head1 NAME

Shipment::Base - base class for a shipping module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module does not DO anything, but can be extended to create a real
interface for a shipping service.

  package Shipment::SomeShippingService;

  use Moose;

  extends 'Shipment::Base';

  sub ship {
    # routine to ship something somewhere via some shipping service
  }

  no Moose;

which can then be used to actually DO stuff:

  use Shipment::SomeShippingService;
  use Shipment::Address;
  use Shipment::Package;

  my $shipment = Shipment::SomeShippingService->new(
    from_address => Shipment::Address->new( ... ),
    to_address => Shipment::Address->new( ... ),
    packages => [ Shipment::Package->new( ... ), ],
  );

  $shipment->ship( 'ground' );

=head1 ABOUT

This is a base class for a shipping service such as UPS or FedEx.
